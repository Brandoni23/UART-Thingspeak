# Introduction
Me and my group designed a system that would allow the user to increase its power generation through the optimization of solar panels' angle tilt. My part was to record the power readings of the solar panel by sending data periodically to Thingspeak. This would allow the user to monitor the system's performance based on its tilt towards the sun. I used an Adafruit Featherboard M0 to build my system with an ESP8266 WIFI module. The code is in CircuitPython language.
